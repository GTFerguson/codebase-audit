# PROVEN Documentation Principles

Project documentation is the institutional memory. Every design decision, algorithm constant, and domain assumption must trace back to documented evidence. Without provenance, knowledge decays into folklore.

Three doc types, each with a distinct role:

| Type | Directory | Purpose | Lifespan |
|------|-----------|---------|----------|
| **Reference** | `docs/reference/` | Evidence base — domain knowledge with citations | Permanent, updated as evidence evolves |
| **Architecture** | `docs/architecture/` | How shipped systems work and why they're designed that way | Permanent, updated when systems change |
| **Plan** | `docs/plans/` | Intent before code exists — what to build and why | Ephemeral, deleted after graduation |

The PROVEN quality principles apply to all three types. The lifecycle flows forward: **research → reference doc → plan → implement → architecture doc → delete plan**.

## The PROVEN Principles

### **P** — Provenance

Every claim traces to a named, dated source. Include author(s), year, title, and journal/publisher.

**Bad — Unsourced claim:**
```markdown
Training volume should be 10-20 sets per muscle group per week for hypertrophy.
```

**Good — Sourced claim:**
```markdown
A dose-response relationship exists between weekly set volume and hypertrophy,
with 10+ weekly sets producing greater effect sizes (ES=0.24) than fewer than 5
(ES=0.07) (Schoenfeld et al., 2017, *Journal of Sports Sciences* 35(11):1073-1082).
```

### **R** — Research-First

Document findings in `docs/reference/` **before** writing code. No implementation without grounding. If you research a topic to inform a design decision, record the findings as a reference doc first — then cite it from the architecture doc or code comments.

**Bad — Research lost in agent context:**
```
Agent searches for "SRA recovery windows", finds papers,
uses numbers directly in code, never records the findings.
```

**Good — Research preserved:**
```
1. Search academic sources
2. Write docs/reference/sra-recovery-windows.md with citations
3. Implement algorithm citing the reference doc
4. Architecture doc references the same source
```

### **O** — One Topic Per Doc

Each reference doc covers a single coherent topic. Split when a doc exceeds ~200 lines. Cross-reference between docs using links rather than duplicating content.

**Bad:** A single doc covering "Training Science" with volume, periodization, recovery, and nutrition all mixed together.

**Good:** Separate docs for `progressive-overload-and-periodization.md`, `overtraining-and-fatigue-management.md`, `sleep-and-recovery-science.md`.

### **V** — Verifiable

Include enough detail to check the original source: sample size, population (trained/untrained), effect size, confidence intervals, journal name. A reader should be able to find and verify every claim.

**Bad — Vague reference:**
```markdown
Studies show that higher volume produces more hypertrophy.
```

**Good — Verifiable reference:**
```markdown
In 34 resistance-trained men (>2 years experience), those performing 5 sets
per exercise achieved greater hypertrophy than those performing 1 set, though
the marginal gain from 3 to 5 sets was smaller than from 1 to 3 sets
(Schoenfeld et al., 2019, *JSCR* 33(12), n=34).
```

### **E** — Evidence-Tiered

Label the quality of each source. Not all evidence is equal. When mixing tiers, state which tier a claim comes from.

| Tier | Source Type | Example |
|------|-----------|---------|
| 1 | Systematic review / meta-analysis | Schoenfeld et al. (2017) dose-response meta-analysis |
| 2 | Randomized controlled trial (RCT) | Amirthalingam et al. (2017) 5 vs 10 sets RCT |
| 3 | Observational / cohort study | Bartholomew et al. (2008) stress and strength gains |
| 4 | Narrative review | Stults-Kolehmainen & Sinha (2014) stress-activity review |
| 5 | Practitioner opinion / textbook | Israetel et al. (2015) volume landmarks framework |

**Bad — Mixing tiers without labeling:**
```markdown
MEV is 6-8 sets per week (Israetel, 2015) and volume has a dose-response
relationship with hypertrophy (Schoenfeld, 2017).
```

**Good — Tiers labeled:**
```markdown
Volume has a dose-response relationship with hypertrophy (Tier 1: Schoenfeld
et al., 2017, meta-analysis of 15 studies). The MEV/MAV/MRV framework
operationalises this into per-muscle landmarks (Tier 5: Israetel, Hoffmann &
Smith, 2015, practitioner textbook with indirect meta-analytic support).
```

### **N** — Not Duplicated

The reference library is the single source of truth. Update existing docs rather than creating overlapping ones. Before creating a new doc, check if the topic is already covered. If it partially overlaps, either extend the existing doc or split it cleanly with cross-references.

## Citation Format

Use inline parenthetical citations with enough detail to locate the source:

```markdown
(Author et al., Year, *Journal* Volume(Issue):Pages, n=SampleSize)
```

For frequently cited works, a full reference can go in a "References" section at the end of the doc:

```markdown
## References

  between weekly resistance training volume and increases in muscle mass:

```

## When to Write a Reference Doc

- Before implementing any algorithm that depends on domain knowledge
- When research is conducted to answer a design question
- When external sources inform thresholds, constants, or heuristics in code
- When a topic comes up repeatedly and the same sources keep being re-searched

## When NOT to Write a Reference Doc

- For implementation details (those go in `docs/architecture/`)
- For how-to instructions (those go in `docs/guides/`)
- For project plans (those go in `docs/plans/`)
- For trivially verifiable facts that don't need citations

## When to Write an Architecture Doc

Architecture docs explain **how a system works and why it was designed that way**. Decisions need rationale, not just description.

- **When a feature or system ships** — graduate design knowledge from the plan (see Plan Docs lifecycle below). Don't wait — context is freshest right after shipping.
- **When significantly changing an existing system** — update the architecture doc to reflect the new reality
- **When design decisions aren't obvious from the code** — tradeoffs, rejected alternatives, and "why not the simpler approach" belong in architecture docs, not code comments
- **When no plan existed** — if a system was built without a plan doc, it still needs an architecture doc once it ships

### What an Architecture Doc Should Cover

- **Purpose** — what problem the system solves and why it exists as a separate component
- **How it works** — data flow, key algorithms, integration points with other systems
- **Design decisions** — why this approach over alternatives, with rationale inline (not in a separate decisions directory)
- **Configuration** — what's tuneable and where the knobs are
- **Boundaries** — what's in scope and what's deliberately excluded

## Plan Docs

Plan docs capture intent before code exists. They are **ephemeral** — once the work ships and design knowledge graduates to other doc types, the plan is deleted. If a plan file exists, there's still work to do.

### Hierarchy

Three tiers, each linking to the next:

| Tier | Purpose | Lifespan | Example |
|------|---------|----------|---------|
| **Roadmap** | Vision-level phases, sequencing, dependencies | Persists while future phases remain | `product-roadmap.md` |
| **Phase plan** | What a major capability adds, key challenges, integration points, open questions | Deleted when shipped and graduated | `cardio-programming.md` |
| **Feature backlog** | Specific features with effort estimates, shipped tracking | Deleted when all items ship and graduate | `product-backlog.md` |

Phase plans link up to their parent roadmap. Backlogs link up to their phase plan. Roadmaps link down to both.

### What a Plan Should Contain

- **Context** — the problem or need, what prompted it
- **What it adds** — capabilities, not implementation detail
- **Key challenges** — the hard parts, not the obvious parts
- **Integration points** — how it connects to existing systems
- **Open questions** — unresolved decisions, noted honestly
- **Evidence links** — wiki-links to reference docs, not duplicated research

Plans are vision-level by default. Implementation detail (data models, API contracts, code structure) belongs in the plan only when a phase is actively being built — not before.

### Lifecycle

```
Plan created → work begins → features ship → graduate → plan deleted
```

**Graduation** means extracting the durable knowledge into the right permanent home:

- Design decisions, data flow, algorithms → architecture doc
- Research findings gathered during planning → reference doc (if not already there)
- The plan itself → `rm`

Don't keep "completed" plans around as historical records — that's what architecture docs and git history are for.

### Roadmap Lifecycle

Roadmaps are the exception — they persist as a progress record. As phases complete:

1. The phase section shrinks to a one-line summary with a link to the architecture doc(s)
2. The detailed phase plan is deleted
3. The roadmap shows what's shipped, what's in progress, and what's ahead

A roadmap is deleted only when all phases are complete and the product vision is fully realised (or abandoned).

### When to Write a Plan

- **Multi-session work** where scope, dependencies, or trade-offs need alignment before implementation
- **Cross-system changes** that touch multiple modules or require coordinated effort
- **New capabilities** that don't have an obvious implementation path

### When NOT to Write a Plan

- Single-feature changes where the implementation is obvious
- Bug fixes (write a test instead)
- Refactoring with a clear target state
- Work that can be fully described in a commit message

## Directory Organisation

Documentation directories should stay navigable as they grow. Structure should emerge from content, not be planned upfront.

- **Cluster by topic** — when a directory reaches ~10 files, group related docs into subdirectories. Don't wait until it's unmanageable.
- **Place new docs in existing subdirectories** — when adding a doc, find the most relevant subdirectory rather than dropping it in the parent.
- **Create subdirectories when a cluster forms** — if 3+ docs share a topic and no subdirectory exists, create one and move them together.
- **Maintain a `README.md` index** — when a directory has subdirectories, keep a root-level index with links to every doc organised by cluster. Update it when adding docs or subdirectories.
- **Keep it organic** — subdirectory names should describe what's inside, not impose a taxonomy. Rename or restructure when the content outgrows the labels.
